        I always enjoyed technology and cars, since a kid. Lately I had a great time building and restoring
        classic cars, sometimes with a modern twist in them, trying to keep the classic design looks and the
        modern parts hidden inside to improve the use of it.

        Who doesn't like when the car can drive far
        away without breaking down, or having the speedometer match the actual speed of the car? Imagine having
        air conditioning on a classic car in the Californian heat? Classic cars sometimes are a piece of art
        that stay stationary because they aren't comfortable to drive, but with customization and modernization
        you
        can connect both modern comfort to the classic design that is so desired by several people!

        From childhood in the 90's self taught about computers and mechanics, designed very basic concepts to
        more complex concepts modifying cars and equipment for more performance and efficiency. Always enjoying
        gaming and technological products. Racing cars and manufacturing custom parts and modifying existing
        components to improve performance.

        When a project starts the work begins, there is a lot of planning and research to execution and then the
        delivery. The process of managing a project is accomplished when product is delivered with success,
        there is several hiccups and twisted roads but on the end, when the product is finalized, a great sense
        of accomplishment is achieved. That's something I really enjoy, nothing better than a nice coffee and
        breakfast in the following day after a big project delivered.

        I learned that you should set a Goal and put effort and commitment to achieve it, hard to do, easy to
        say, resources and time has to be allocated properly, the earlier you organize everything higher the
        chance of success.

    <p> Communication is key in a group, sometimes a person is so good at something and
        nobody knows. If you don't ask you rarely have an answer! A team where everyone truly feel comfortable
        to talk and work will deliver better.
